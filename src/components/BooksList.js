        <p>Books are crucial in every student’s life because they introduce children to a world of imagination, provide information of the outside world, improve their reading, writing, and speaking abilities, and improve memory and intellect. Students benefit much from books, and they learn a great deal from them. They immerse children in a distinct realm of fantasy while also raising their living standards. Reading books has several advantages; children will get more information, increase their memory, and expand their vocabulary.</p>
